**What is EMDR?**

EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy is a short-term program that helps individuals who have experienced a traumatic event learn how to better manage their emotions and sensations. 

The goal of EMDR therapy is to help individuals learn how to trust their own senses and emotions in order to cope with the trauma. This can be done by learning about how the body responds to trauma and then using these techniques to work through the emotions that remain.

EMDR therapy has been shown to be very effective in helping individuals feel more in control of their emotions and sensations. In some cases, EMDR has even been able to help survivors retrieve memories that they may have been unable to recall before. These memories can help individuals move on from the experience and provide them with new perspectives on what happened.

EMDR therapy is a great way for individuals to process and cope with a traumatic event. It can provide them with valuable tools that they can use in order to improve their lives moving forward.

A session usually lasts one to two hours, but can be extended depending on the individual's needs.

**How do I use this app?**

1. Open the app: [http://eyemovement.online](eyemovement.online)
2. Decide if you want to use your primary or secondary screen. If you want to use a secondary screen, click the 'Open' button, and drag the new window to the second screen.
3. Choose the movement mode 
  - 'Bounce' hits each wall and reverses direction as you would expect
  - 'Sweep' pauses briefly at each edge of the screen
  - 'Sine' undulates and wiggles back and forth in a complex pattern
  - 'Blink' flashes briefly at each edge, and disappears while moving
4. Choose the ball color, size, and bounce (y-direction randomness). Bounce may have different effects depending on the movement mode.
5. Go fullscreen, or toggle the timer, if you like.
6. Start the session by pressing the 'Start' or 'Start Remote' button and begin therapy.

**What's different about this app?**

There are other free EMDR apps, eg. [bilateralstimulation.io/](https://www.bilateralstimulation.io/) but none that I have found allow the ball to move up and down, only left to right.
There is some evidence that vertical as well as horizontal motion is important for effective therapy.
